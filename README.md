 <h2>Introduction to Project </h2>
  <p>A data dashboard is an information management tool used to track, analyze, and display key performance indicators, metrics, and data points. You can use a dashboard to monitor the overall health of your business, department, or a specific process.
    We have taken the data of Crypto Currencies for the dashboard implementation because we can see the importance of blockchain technologies and crypto exchanges is rising day by day exponentially.We have created the very simple dashboard without heavy setup.
